1) 
	Large objects (photos, videos, CAD files, etc.) are stored as
	a large object:
	• blob: binary large object -- object is a large collection of
	uninterpreted binary data (whose interpretation is left to
	an application outside of the database system)
	• clob: character large object -- object is a large collection
	of character data
	 When a query returns a large object, a pointer is returned
	rather than the large object itself

2) 
A role is a way to distinguish among various users as far
as what these users can access/update in the database. Roles can own database objects and can assign privileges on those objects to other roles to control who has access to which objects. Privileges: select, insert, update, delete. We give roles to user with some privileges.
